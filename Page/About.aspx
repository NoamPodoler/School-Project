            <h3> This website was created by Noam Podoler as part of a yearly project in the 11th grade computer science class in the The Yarkon Education Center. As a poerson who loves to watch a lot of TV Series, I always looked for reccomendations about TV series I havent watched yet. I thought of the idea of creating a website of which is based on everybodys reccomendations which will provide people the best and most trending Tv series, Movies and more every single month.</h3>
